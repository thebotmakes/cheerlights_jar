Neopixel light up jar, with colour controlled by Cheerlights!

![alt text](https://github.com/thebotmakes/cheerlights_jar/blob/master/IMG_1292.jpg "tracker_image")

This uses a 24 LED Adafruit neopixel ring and a Huzzah ESP8266 Feather to control the lights, with the lights being set by the @cheerlights Twitter account.  This means the colour of the jar is remotely set, along with lights anywhere in the world set up to sync with Cheerlights.  

This code is based on the Adafruit Feather HUZZAH & Neopixel Cheerlights project by Marc de Vinck here:

All I've had to do is rejig the colour coding to better suit the neopixel ring I'm using (the pink in the original code was more white with my neopixels, purple was more pink etc.).
