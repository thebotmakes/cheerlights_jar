Neopixel light up jar, with colour controlled by Cheerlights!

This uses a 24 LED Adafruit neopixel ring and a Huzzah ESP8266 Feather to control the lights, with the lights being set by the @cheerlights Twitter account.  This means the colour of the jar is remotely set, along with lights anywhere in the world set up to sync with Cheerlights.  This code is mostly borrowed from the Adafruit Feather HUZZAH & Neopixel Cheerlights by Marc de Vinck.
